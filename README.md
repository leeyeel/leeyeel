# ðŸŒŸ Hi ~Â Â 

A full-stack engineer with a stronger expertise in audio and video codec development.

I specialize in high-energy physics and have worked on various projects, including
the development of Battery Management Systems(BMS) for electric vehicles, 
Linux driver development for IP Camera(IPC), and log-term experience in audio and video development.

I still enjoy tinkering around and creating seemingly "useless" things.
